# ClickML – End-to-End ML Lifecycle Platform 

#### ClickML is a modular, full-stack MLOps platform that converts UI-based workflow actions into executable machine learning jobs.
#### It manages the complete ML lifecycle — from data ingestion and preprocessing to pretraining, fine-tuning, quantization, registry tracking, and deployment.
#### Designed for scalability, reproducibility, and hardware compatibility.

## Vision

ClickML simplifies complex ML engineering workflows into structured, traceable pipelines without sacrificing flexibility or control.

It is built for:
- ML Engineers
- AI Researchers
- Data Engineers
- Students building production-grade ML systems

---
# Objectives
- To allow users to create configurable ETL pipelines.
- To automate pipeline scheduling using Apache Airflow.
- To provide a no-code machine learning model creation interface.
- To store processed and raw data in the user’s database.
- To support model training for regression and classification problems.
- To generate pickle files and comprehensive model reports.
- To deploy ML models via API endpoints.
- To create a robust frontend for seamless user interaction.

# Why ClickML Stands Out

- Full ML lifecycle coverage
- Built-in reproducibility
- UI → executable pipeline conversion
- Model lineage tracking
- Registry-driven deployment
- Modular & scalable architecture

# Future Roadmap

- RAG pipeline integration

- LLM fine-tuning modules

- Experiment tracking dashboard
